title: Websockets

Using Websockets is super easy! By nature Websockets are a bit different than standard Http Request / Response lifecycle.

You can easily create a websocket handler which matches the route of `ws://host:port/route. You can create more than 1 websocket handler
with different routes.

```ruby
ws "/" do |socket|

end

ws "/route2" do |socket|

end
```

Let's access the socket and create a simple echo server.

```ruby
# Matches "/"
ws "/" do |socket|
  # Send welcome message to the client
  socket.send "Hello from Kemal!"

  # Handle incoming message and echo back to the client
  socket.on_message do |message|
    socket.send "Echo back from server #{message}"
  end

  # Executes when the client is disconnected. You can do the cleaning up here.
  socket.on_close do
    puts "Closing socket"
  end
end
```
